gmx_MMPBSA is a new tool based on AMBER's MMPBSA.py aiming to perform end-state 
free energy calculations with GROMACS files. This program is an adaptation of 
Amber's MMPBSA.py and essentially works as such. As gmx_MMPBSA adapts MMPBSA.py, 
since it has all the resources of this script and work with any GROMACS version.

                         (default: False)
  -use-mdins            Use existing input files for each calculation. If they do
                         not exist with the appropriate names, gmx_MMPBSA will
                         quit in error. (default: False)
  -rewrite-output       Do not re-run any calculations, just parse the output

### Running gmx_MMPBSA

!!! tip
    * Since version 1.4.0 we have fixed the `gmx_MMPBSA` inconsistencies when using `MPI`.
    * **We currently recommend the use of MPI since the computation time decreases considerably.**

=== "Parallel (MPI) version"
    `gmx_MMPBSA` as `MMPBSA.py` uses the `MPI` only to perform the calculations during the dynamics, the rest of 
    the process (Generation/conversion of Amber topologies, mutation, division of the trajectories, etc) occurs in 
    a single thread (See **Figure 1[^1]** for better reference). This means that it is not necessary to install any 
    program (AmberTools or GROMACS) with `MPI`, which can be used in any circumstance, and the time required to 
    process the data prior to the calculation depends on the system and will be the same for both versions (`Serial` 
    and `MPI`). 

    !!! note
        Note that `gmx_MMPBSA` processes, converts, or builds topologies from GROMACS files, so it takes slightly 
        longer than `MMPBSA.py` at the same stage of the process. However, this is not really significant.


    ???+ tip "Remember" 
        Make sure that you install the OpenMPI library
        
            sudo apt install openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev openssh-client

    A usage example is shown below:

    === "Local"
    
            mpirun -np 2 gmx_MMPBSA MPI -O -i mmpbsa.in -cs com.tpr -ci index.ndx -cg 1 13 -ct com_traj.xtc
    
    === "HPC"
    
            #!/bin/sh
            #PBS -N nmode
            #PBS -o nmode.out
            #PBS -e nmode.err
            #PBS -m abe
            #PBS -M email@domain.edu
            #PBS -q brute
            #PBS -l nodes=1:surg:ppn=3
            #PBS -l pmem=1450mb or > 5gb for nmode calculation
            
            cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
            
            mpirun -np 3 gmx_MMPBSA MPI -O -i mmpbsa.in -cs com.tpr -ci index.ndx -cg 1 13 -ct com_traj.xtc > progress.log

    
    !!! danger
        Unfortunately, when `gmx_MMPBSA` is run with `MPI`, GROMACS's `gmx_mpi` is incompatible. This is probably 
        because of `gmx_mpi` conflicts with mpirun. In any case, this is not a problem since `gmx` works correctly 
        and `gmx_mpi` only parallels `mdrun`, the rest of the GROMACS tools work in a single thread. See this 
        [issue](https://github.com/Valdes-Tresanco-MS/gmx_MMPBSA/issues/26) to see the output.

    !!! warning
        The nmode calculations require a considerable amount of RAM. Consider that the total amount of RAM will be:

        RAM~total~ = RAM~1_frame~ * NUM of Threads
        
        If it consumes all the RAM of the system it can cause crashes, instability or system shutdown!
        

    !!! note
        At a certain level, running RISM in parallel may actually hurt performance, since previous solutions are used 
        as an initial guess for the next frame, hastening convergence. Running in parallel loses this advantage. Also, 
        due to the overhead involved in which each thread is required to load every topology file when calculating 
        energies, parallel scaling will begin to fall off as the number of threads reaches the number of frames. 

=== "Serial version"
    This version is installed via pip as described above. `AMBERHOME` variable must be set, or it will quit with an error. 
    An example command-line call is shown below:
    
        gmx_MMPBSA -O -i mmpbsa.in -cs com.tpr -ci index.ndx -cg 1 13 -ct com_traj.xtc

### Running gmx_MMPBSA_ana
In order to analyze multiple systems in the same section and implement the correlation between them, we improved the 
file input to gmx_MMPBSA_ana. Currently, gmx_MMPBSA_ana supports info files, the folder that contains it or a list 
of them.

Additionally, you can pass as input one or more folders containing multiple systems using `recursive`. The folders 
must be the following structure:

=== "Valid folder structure"
    
    Here all folders (5 systems) will be processed by `gmx_MMPBSA_ana`
    ```
    Defined folder
      ├── System-1
      │      └── _GMXMMPBSA_info
      ├── System-2
      │      └── _GMXMMPBSA_info
      ├── System-3
      │      └── _GMXMMPBSA_info
      ├── System-4
      │      └── _GMXMMPBSA_info
      └── System-5
             └── _GMXMMPBSA_info
    ```

=== "Valid folders + files structure"

    Here all systems (4) will be processed by `gmx_MMPBSA_ana`
    ```
    System-1      
      └──_GMXMMPBSA_info
    Folder-1
      ├── System-2.1
      │      └── _GMXMMPBSA_info
      └── System-2.2
             └── _GMXMMPBSA_info
    System-3 (_GMXMMPBSA_info)
    ```
    
    !!! tip ""
        The command-line for this is:

            gmx_MMPBSA_ana -f /path/to/System-1 /path/to/System-3/_GMXMMPBSA_info /path/to/Folder-1 -r
        
        This estructure only work if recursive option was defined. See the examples below
    
    !!! note ""
        Note that:

        * `System-1` is defined as folder that contain a _GMXMMPBSA_info
        * Folder-1 contain two folder (Systems), each containing a _GMXMMPBSA_info
        * System-3 is defined as a _GMXMMPBSA_info file


=== "Wrong folder structure"
    
    Here only  4 (systems) folders will be processed by gmx_MMPBSA_ana. The systems in the `Internal folder` will be 
    ignored 
    ```
    Defined folder
      ├── System-1

                        The level at which you want to take the test.
                        * all - make all examples.
                        * minimal - does a minimal test with a set of systems and 
                                    analyzes that show that gmx_MMPBSA runs 
                                    correctly. Only exclude 3drism and nmode 
                                    because they can take a long time and 
                                    prot_lig_mt because it is quite similar to

### Running gmx_MMPBSA_test
gmx_MMPBSA_test is designed to run a set of samples (all or minimal) or a specific example efficiently. 
Additionally, gmx_MMPBSA_test can run in parallel, decreasing the execution time gmx_MMPBSA_test will download the 
most recent version of the repository in the specified folder and will perform the calculations

=== "minimal"
    
        gmx_MMPBSA_test -f /home/user/Documents -n 10 [-t minimal is the default]
    
    Through this command-line, gmxMMPBSA_test will:
    
    * Download gmx_MMPBSA repository content in `/home/user/Documents`
    * Do `minimal` set of examples
    * Perform the calculation on 10 examples at the sime time (1 processor per example)

=== "all"
    
        gmx_MMPBSA_test -f /home/user/Documents -t all -n 10
    
    Through this command-line, gmxMMPBSA_test will:
    
    * Download gmx_MMPBSA repository content in `/home/user/Documents`
    * Do `all` set of examples
    * Perform the calculation on 10 examples at the sime time (1 processor per example)
    
=== "specific"
    
        gmx_MMPBSA_test -f /home/user/Documents -t prot_lig_st
    
    Through this command-line, gmxMMPBSA_test will:
    
    * Download gmx_MMPBSA repository content in `/home/user/Documents`
    * Do `prot_lig_st`[Protein-Ligand (Single Trajectory approach)] example
