# Changelog
## [gxm_MMPBSA v1.4.3 (26/05/2021)](https://github.com/Valdes-Tresanco-MS/gmx_MMPBSA/releases/tag/v1.4.3)
### Additions
- Added two new tutorials [Protein_ligand_LPH_atoms_CHARMMff](https://valdes-tresanco-ms.github.io/gmx_MMPBSA/examples/Protein_ligand_LPH_atoms_CHARMMff/) and [QM/MMGBSA calculations](https://valdes-tresanco-ms.github.io/gmx_MMPBSA/examples/QM_MMGBSA/)
- Now the program reports the `p-value` associated with the correlation coefficient when performing the correlation analysis
- Google Analytics is used as a third-party tracking service to improve documentation. Check our [Private Policy](https://valdes-tresanco-ms.github.io/gmx_MMPBSA/private_policy/) for more details

### Fixes
