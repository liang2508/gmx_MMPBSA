## Example

!!! note "Important"
    This does not constitute by any means the only way to cite `gmx_MMPBSA` and programs/methods implemented in it. It 
    is just meant to serve as a guidance.

Here there is an example on how to cite `gmx_MMPBSA` and programs/methods implemented in it:

**MM/GBSA calculations**

PBC conditions were removed from GROMACS output trajectory before running the calculations with gmx_MMPBSA.[^1^][1]^,^[^2^][2]
Energetically relevant residues within 5 Å at the interface were predicted using the per-residue effective free energy 
decomposition (prEFED) protocol.[^3^][3] The AMBER99SB force field[^5^][5] was used to calculate the internal
term (ΔE~int~) as well as van der Waals (ΔE~vdW~) and electrostatic (ΔE~ele~) energies. The GB-Neck2 model 
(igb = 8)[^6^][6] was used to estimate the polar component of the solvation energy (ΔG~GB~) while the non-polar solvation
free energy (∆𝐺~𝑆𝐴~) was obtained by the equation:

<p align="center">
    ∆𝐺<sub>𝑆𝐴</sub> = 𝛾 · ∆𝑆𝐴𝑆𝐴 + 𝛽
</p>

where ∆𝑆𝐴𝑆𝐴 represents the solvent-accessible surface area variation of the solute molecule  upon complex formation, 
and 𝛾 and 𝛽 are empiric constants whose values for GB models are 0.0072 kcal·Å^-2^·mol^-1^ and 0, 
respectively.[^7^][7]^,^[^8^][8] The entropic term was calculated by the Interaction Entropy method.[^9^][9] The input 
file for gmx_MMPBSA decomposition calculation is shown below:

```

Computational alanine scanning[^10^][10] was performed for five residues (TP62, EP68, EP70, HP76, and EP83) with a specific 
internal dielectric constant as suggested by Yan et al.[^11^][11] and according to the chemical-physical properties of the 
mutated amino acid (i.e., e~i~ = 5 for charged residues; e~i~ = 3 for polar residues; and e~i~ = 1 for hydrophobic 
residues). An example of the input file for gmx_MMPBSA alanine scanning (EP68 residue) calculation is shown below:
